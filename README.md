# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

Grace’s note: This is a line from RStudio.

Adrian’s note: This is a line from RStudio.

Naomi’s note: This is a line from RStudio.

Izzy’s note: This is a line from RStudio.

Group Note: While making changes, we realized it would be easier if only
one person made edits at a time. So for our notes on each step, we
decided that one person should paste all our pre-written notes in to
avoid issues.

12.2

- Grace: I used our team 11 repository and copied the URL to clipboard.

- Adrian: Went to a pre-made repository for the lab.

- Naomi: I used the link on Canvas and created the team repository.

- Izzy: I used the link for our team repository and accepted the
  assignment for lab 1, which allowed me to add it to my github.

12.3

- Grace: I created a new project using our repository URL.

- Adrian: Clone the git repository to my computer using RStudio–no
  errors yet but this would ultimately be done wrong.

- Naomi: I cloned the git repository to my computer.

- Izzy: In RStudio I went to create a new project and clicked version
  control to paste and create a clone of the repository.

12.4

- Grace: Modified README.md file by adding the line “Grace’s note: This
  is a line from RStudio.” I had minor issues at first because I did not
  click the correct “staged” box. Our group figured out that issue
  shortly so I checked the correct “staged” box and committed, making
  sure that I added a commit message.

- Adrian: I made some local changes and had difficulties committing
  them. However, the nature of these errors would not become clear until
  I tried to push.

- Naomi: I modified the README.rmd file, then I committed those changes.

- Izzy: In the readme.rmd file I added a line that said “Izzy’s note:
  This is a line from RStudio.” I had a lot of issues with committing
  and then pushing this because I created the wrong type of token in
  github, which would not give me access to the repository. Now, I am
  able to make edits and push them.

12.5

- Grace: I pushed the changes to GitHub by clicking the “push” button.

- Adrian: After I tried to make and push changes and they were unable to
  go through, Naomi told me that I needed to save my repo outside of
  onedrive. After correcting this and trying again to push a change, I
  encountered another issue, as my version of the file did not match the
  one on github. After stashing my changes and pulling, I was able to
  push an initial change with Grace’s help.

- Naomi: I pushed my change to the remote. I didn’t want to have any
  merge conflicts, so I waited for a time in class when nobody else was
  editing.

- Izzy: Again, as I explained my issue with this in 12.4, I was able to
  create a new token that allowed me to push my local changes to github.

12.6

- Grace: I went to GitHub and confirmed that the change “Grace’s note:
  This is a line from RStudio.” was displayed in the README.

- Adrian: My changes appeared with prior changes on the github document.

- Naomi: I went to GitHub and viewed my changes.

- Izzy: I was able to find all of the past commits in github from the
  readme with no issues.
